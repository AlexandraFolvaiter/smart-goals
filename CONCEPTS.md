# Project business logic - base concepts

This project has as core concepts the following:

A person has 8 Areas (or more, if needed) to focus on:
- Health & Energy
- Career & Business
- Money & Finance
- Relationships & Love & Family
- Lifestyle
- Personal growth
- Social & Friends
- Spirituality

In order to grow, a person can start organize each area based on some simple concepts as goals and objectives.

A **goal** is the object of a person's ambition or effort; an aim or desired result.

An **objective** is a thing aimed at or sought, statements describing the results to be achieved, and the manner in which they will be achieved. You usually need multiple objectives to address a single goal.

A person can have a goal and for that goal can have a list with objectives. In order to not set abstract expectations, an objective should respect a set of guidelines, that means that an objective should be SMART:

- **Specific**: includes the “who”, “what”, and “where”. Use only one action verb to avoid issues with measuring success.
- **Measurable**: focuses on “how much” change is expected.
- **Achievable**: realistic given program resources and planned implementation.
- **Relevant**: relates directly to program/activity goals.
- **Time-bound**: focuses on “when” the objective will be achieved.
